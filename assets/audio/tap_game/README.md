# Tap Game Audio Assets

## Required Audio File

Place the following audio file in this directory:
- `confirm-tap-394001.mp3` - Tap sound effect

## Audio Requirements for Low Latency

For best performance on Android with minimal delay:
- Use short audio clips (< 1 second)
- Prefer MP3 or OGG format
- Keep file size small (< 100KB if possible)
- Use lower sample rates (22050 Hz or 44100 Hz)
- Mono audio instead of stereo when possible

The audio file should be a short, crisp tap/click sound for immediate feedback.
